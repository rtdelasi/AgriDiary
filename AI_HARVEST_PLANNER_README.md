# AI-Powered Harvest Planner

## Overview

The Agridiary app now features an AI-powered harvest planner that replaces the hard-coded harvest planning system with intelligent, data-driven predictions and recommendations.

## Key Features

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Predictions
- **Dynamic Yield Predictions**: Instead of hard-coded yield expectations, the AI analyzes multiple factors to predict crop yields
- **Optimal Planting Times**: AI determines the best planting dates based on weather conditions, historical data, and crop requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential risks like weather conditions, historical performance issues, and market volatility

### ðŸ“Š Intelligent Analysis
- **Weather Integration**: Analyzes temperature, rainfall, and humidity patterns
- **Historical Performance**: Learns from past harvest data to improve predictions
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Considers seasonal factors that affect crop growth
- **Market Factors**: Incorporates market volatility and trends

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Recommendations
- **Personalized Advice**: Provides crop-specific recommendations based on current conditions
- **Risk Mitigation**: Suggests strategies to address identified risks
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors AI prediction accuracy and provides insights

## How It Works

## Configuration

### Weather API Setup
To use real weather data, replace the simulated weather in `_getWeatherForecast()` with actual API calls:

```dart
// Example with OpenWeatherMap API
final response = await http.get(Uri.parse(
  'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=$location&appid=$apiKey&units=metric'
));
```

### AI Model Training
The system can be enhanced by:
- Collecting more historical data
- Training custom ML models
- Integrating with agricultural databases
- Adding more environmental factors
